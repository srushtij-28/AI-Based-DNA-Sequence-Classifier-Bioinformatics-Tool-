# 🧬 DNA Sequence Classifier 

## 💡 Overview
The **DNA Sequence Classifier** is an offline Python application that uses **Machine Learning** to determine whether a DNA sequence is **Healthy** or **Mutated**.

It applies **character-level pattern analysis** and **Naive Bayes classification**, similar to how real bioinformatics systems detect genetic variations.

This project demonstrates how AI is used in **genetics, healthcare, and biomedical research**.
